Build requirements:
-------------------
mkdir -p $HOME/work/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/work/go

go get github.com/op/go-logging

A basic build can be then tested with "go build" in the mlogd source
directory.

Or, 

go get github.com/msoulier/mlogd
cd $GOPATH && go install mlogd

and the executable will be in the $GOPATH/bin directory.
